  <h1>Researching dance therapy, from the perspective of a dancer</h1>
  <p class="byline"><i>Anna Süheyla Harms, <time>January 3rd 2023</time></i></p>
</header>
<p>
My name is Anna and I am a 34 year old professional dancer, originally
from Australia. In 2021 I received a state funded artist scholarship, (DIS-TANZ-SOLO) to
carry out my own artistic research. I endeavoured to research the field
of dance therapy, looking at it as a possible enriching career to my
dancing. With this article I would like to illustrate some of the themes
that guided my research and the questions I was asking myself and others
about dance therapy. In doing so I will integrate parts of the
conversations I had with those people who so generously shared their
time and expertise with me.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the Berufsverband der TanztherapeutInnen Deutschland, I was
able to send out a survey to its members which was just invaluable for
gathering personal experiences from dance therapists all over Germany. I
found people’s responses to my questions so enlightening that I have
included some of them here in this article. If it wasn’t already so long
I would have loved to include even more!<br />
<br />
I am not a professional writer, but I will do my best to organise all of
this information into a coherent text which will hopefully be
informative for anyone curious about dance therapy!

<h2 id="introduction">Introducing myself and my interview partners; Mona, Dirk and
Andrew</h2>
<br />
The past few years were quite tumultuous for me, as for many people. Not
only was my livelihood taken away from me for a time as the Corona
lockdowns started, but I was already in the midst of rediscovering what
kind of artist I was and wanted to be, as I left the security of the
company world and transitioned into freelancing during 2018/2019. That
self-investigation accompanied me throughout this time of practical and
personal research.<br />
<br />
As you can imagine, I had many questions going into this research
project. Some of them were very concrete. For example, ‘How does one
become a ‘dance therapist’? What are the different educational pathways,
how much does it cost?’. Attending a couple of ‘open day’ type seminars
run by dance therapist training institutions around Cologne answered a
lot of those questions. The facts and practical steps were relatively
easy to find out and I won’t go into that here. The more personal side
of things was definitely a process, one which still continues
today!<br />
<br />
The most influential part of my research came through reaching out and
having inspiring conversations with people who were/are active and
integral to the dance therapy scene. These encounters were definite
‘eye-opening’ moments for me, and became catalysts for self-reflection
and exploration. Let me shortly introduce Mona Weniger, Dirk
Kazmierczak, and Andrew Morrish, who all agreed to share their time and
words with me.<br />
<br />
I met Mona Weniger through a dance project in Esslingen, where I danced
together with her daughter Laura in an inclusive dance ensemble called
‘DieTanzKompanie’. Mona studied her Masters in Dance Therapy in New York
in the 70’s/80’s, and was a pioneer in bringing dance therapy as it is
now known, to Germany, and in founding the Deutsche Gesellschaft für
Tanztherapie (DGT).<br />
<br />
Dirk Kazmierczak is a dancer and dance therapist. I met Dirk at the
DITAT/Bonn Open Day Seminar where he is a teacher and instructor. I was
immediately keen to talk more with Dirk, given his background as a
dancer. I knew it would be interesting to speak with someone with the
same background as me, who might have spent time thinking about similar
things.<br />
<br />
Andrew Morrish is an Australian performer and improviser whom I met in
Stuttgart when he gave an improvisation workshop. At the time I wasn’t
thinking about dance therapy, and only came across his name on the
website of the Australian Dance Therapy Association once I began
researching this topic.<br />
<br />
<strong>Their personal stories: how did you get into dance therapy?
</strong><br />
I have left these responses in quite some detail as I think they are
super interesting stories and help in understanding the perspectives of
each person.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: 'That’s a good question, I think it was like this: at some
point I was doing a lot of dance theatre, and I was asking myself, what
is an authentic movement? At the same time I was also teaching a lot,
not only ballet but also modern dance and improvisation, working with
older people, and children. I noticed that when the movement got very
personal, it could trigger something, and that people could communicate
a lot. It was important to be able to hold them and support them through
this process, which can sometimes go very deep. I also noticed how
certain dynamics occur within a group, and that made me ask what it is
going on there, why does he or she move like that? I was approached to
give private lessons, but more like a physical coach. It started out
with questions like ‘how to walk?’, but soon developed into something
more dance therapeutical. At that time I had a different perspective.
Therapy usually means that there is something pathological there, that
someone has a condition, or a diagnosis. It also usually means yes, I
know what to do, I have a method and I want to heal someone or at least
help them improve something. For that you need a method, tools, and
certification. At the same time I was asking myself questions regarding
my own life. I was leaving the stage feeling empty and without
connection to what I was doing. I find that sometimes professional
dancers are dissociated from their bodies, it functions, but there is no
connection. I started questioning that, and so I think it came from both
sides.’ </span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: 'For me there is a difference between my academic and my
personal biographies for how I got into dance therapy. I’ll start with
the academic one:</span><br />
<span>I first did an apprenticeship to become a teacher of
Expression-gymnastics in the Bode method. I wanted to be useful for
people’s health. It was a great foundation, a very intensive and healthy
way to improve my perception of body and how I can be useful in life,
through movement and through dance. I was lucky that I got a job at a
primary school right after graduating, teaching sport and music. After
two years I wanted to pursue the dance aspect more intensively, so I
reduced my hours at the school to be able to teach in other contexts
like giving workshops and courses, and to work with adults. I listened
as people, especially the women that I worked with, described
improvements in their physical and mental states… ‘it does me so good’,
‘my migraines are better’, ’my depression is less’. It was such honest
work, and such an encouragement to continue on this path. Back then
there was no ‘dance therapy’ as we know it day, it was all a process of
searching and feeling. </span><br />
<span>When a new psychiatry clinic opened in the community, I submitted an
open application and was immediately placed on the closed ward. There I
received such a crash course in what dance therapy can and cannot do.
The doctors were completely open to my methods, we worked together as
equals in this important and pioneering research work. They, from the
psychological and medicinal aspect, and me from the movement and dance
aspect. This was around the middle/end of the 70’s, when electroshock
therapy was still in use in the clinic as well. I found that very
disturbing at the time. </span><br />
<span>I was still reading and studying for myself during that time, and I
came to realise that with only my certificate as a gymnastic teacher I
wouldn’t be able to get much further. I applied for courses all along
the east coast of America, and was accepted at the New York University.
There I received my Masters in Dance Therapy. It was a revelation,
everything fell into place. Dance therapy was 50 or 60 years ahead over
there. I had great professional opportunities presented to me in
America. However, I felt the collective trauma and how it was to be a
German in America after the second World War, and realising that I could
never be happy in America I returned to Germany to bring dance therapy
with me. Once back in Germany I was part of the founding of the
Deutsches Gesellschaft für Tanztherapie. Rainer Brückmann and I had our
own small institute in Cologne and in Essen, from 1983 until 1991 until
our daughter Laura was born. </span><br />
<br />
<span>The personal side of the story has a lot to do with my family’s
history. I realised very early on that me and my siblings needed
therapy. Through attending a group therapy session with my sister, I had
the revelation that the body and mind need to unite. There is a healing
way through movement and dance and I knew I wanted to follow this path.
I had done a lot of gestalt therapy, an intensive personal therapeutical
process in order to save myself. One's own story is always the driving
force at the beginning to get into this therapeutic work. You have to be
good, healthy and conscious, and able to work on your own
shadow.’</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>ANDREW</strong>: ‘Well I think the history of dance therapy in Australia, as
a concept, and as a reality, it goes back to Hanny Exiner. Hanny was a
dancer with Gertrude Bodenwieser dancer in the 1930’s and 40’s. She came
to Australia with the Bodenwieser Company from Vienna. I think the
company was stranded by the war whilst on tour to South America and
Australia. Hanny was Jewish and I think Madame Bodenwieser was also. So
the company decided they could not return to Europe. Some chose to stay
in Australia, in both Melbourne and Sydney I think. Hanny was one of the
young dancers who settled in Melbourne. She had a studio in Collins St
for many years, teaching and making choreographies. Her generation were
a big influence on bringing the German Expressionist style to Australia.
Hanny eventually was taught dance at the Melbourne Kindergarten Teachers
College, which was later amalgamated with Melbourne University. In the
1970’s she set up a course called the Graduate Diploma in Movement and
Dance, 2 year part time diploma for people who wanted to teach “creative
movement“in schools. She also staffed the course with some very
extraordinary women, in particular Phil Lloyd, Karen Bond and Linda
Leah.</span><br />
<span>The curriculum was very influenced by Laban Movement Analysis (LMA),
encouraging students to develop their teaching from that basis. I
enrolled in the course in 1981, by then there were two streams, one in
education and one in therapy.</span><br />
<span>At the time I was a very unhappy primary school teacher. I had
discovered dancing for myself in my early twenties, dancing to rock and
roll bands in pubs. The education department had a scheme were you could
take unpaid leave for up to 2 years to study, so I enrolled in the
Graduate Diploma really to get a break from the classroom. I was pretty
sure I did not want to return to being a primary school teach so I chose
their therapy stream in my second year.</span><br />
<span>It was very much influenced by LMA as a tool for curriculum
development, and taught with a lot of passion and vision by Hanny. Phil
Lloyd’s background was the Laban influenced Dance Curriculum in England
which was part of the physical education curriculum in the UK and
Australia. Karen Bond, from the U.S. was very influenced by her
background in U.S. west coast liberal arts. She is a very expansive
thinker and now is head of Dance at Temple University. Linda Leah was
from Melbourne but had studied LMA in New York and was also working with
Joan Skinner in Seattle.</span><br />
<span>There was no training of technique in the known dance styles.
Everything was taught via movement exploration using Laban frameworks
and they accepted people with very little conventional dance training
(like me). </span><br />
<span>At that time the therapy stream really looked at teaching people
with disabilities, so in effect it was a training in adaptive teaching
and how to develop a curriculum for a specific population.</span><br />
<span>Once I had graduated I ran a program for 10 years for preschool
children with a huge variety of disabilities at Royal Victorian
Institute for the Blind (RVIB). I was doing both group work (which I
really considered as training for the care workers) and individual
sessions with the children.</span><br />
<span>Before that I had been Karen Bond’s research assistant for her PhD
working with Deaf Blind Children at RVIB. During that time I referred to
myself as a dance specialist, as I felt that the term dance therapist
should be reserved for the time when there was some kind of training and
certification.</span><br />
<span>Also after my graduation I helped to form the “Dance Therapy
Development Group” which eventually became the Dance Therapy Association
of Australia. That group invited Dr Marcia Leventhal to conduct training
workshops in Dance Therapy which she did for many years. Most of this
group had completed the Graduate Diploma, and contained another group of
formidable women from a variety of professional disciplines including
Psychology, Physiotherapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech Pathology, and
Education.</span><br />
<span>At that time (late 1980’s) we were finding ways in which dance could
be used broadly therapeutically, i.e in a generalised “improving well
being” approach. I was cautious about calling it dance therapy until the
structures for training and certification were in place, which happened
in the 1990’s. I pretty much left dance therapy practice around 1994. I
feel in retrospect there was a fair bit of burn out involved in this
decision, and after that though remaining interested, I turned more to
my own improvisation practice.’</span><br />
<br />
Here I would like to include some of the responses from the survey, as
people wrote what motivated them to pursue dance therapy.<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Der Tanz anders zu nutzen als nur für die Bühne in ihrer
Perfektion.’ (Mitte 50, 7 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘To use dance in a way other than for its perfection on the stage.’ (Mid
50’s, 7 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Ich wollte Tanz, Kreativität und Heilung verbinden.’ (Mitte 30,
2 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘I wanted to combine dance, creativity and healing.’ (Mid 30’s, 2 yrs
practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Nach meiner Karriere als Bühnentänzerin und vielen Jahren als
Ballett-/Modern-/Jazztanzlehrerin an privaten Schulen wollte ich mein
Interessen an Psychologie und Tanz verbinden und einer anderen, für mich
sehr spannenden Bedeutung von Bewegung/Tanz Raum geben.’ (Anfang 60, 13
Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘After my career as a dancer and many years of teaching
ballet/modern/jazz at private schools I wanted to combine my interest in
psychology and dance, and to give space to another meaning for movement
and dance, which I find very exciting,.’ (Early 60’s, 13 yrs
practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Die wunderbare Wirkung des Tanzes, die ich selber kenne, auch
anderen zugänglich zu machen.’ (Mitte 60, 11 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘To make the wonderful effects of dance, which I myself feel, accessible
to others.’ (Mid 60’s, 11 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Interesse an der heilenden Kraft des Tanzes.’ (Ende 30, 8 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘An interest in the healing power of dance.’ (Late 30’s, 8 yrs
practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘In meinem Grundberuf als Physiotherapeutin stieß ich speziell
mit Schmerzpatientinnen an therapeutische Grenzen. Parallel entdeckte
ich für mich persönlich den Tanz als schöpferisches Element.’ (Mitte 50,
20 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘In my original profession as physiotherapist, especially with pain
patients, I was arriving at therapeutical limits. At the same time, I
discovered dance as a creative element for myself.’ (Mid 50’s, 20 yrs
practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>'War Tänzerin und liebe das Tanzen. Ich hatte immer das Gefühl,
dass es natürlicher und für die Menschheit heilsamer wäre, wenn nicht
einige wenige extreme Tanztechniken betreiben und die anderen zuschauen,
sondern wenn viele Menschen tanzen und es für sich auf heilsame Art
nutzen können.’ (Anfang 50, 2 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘I was a dancer, and love dance. I always had the feeling that it would
be more natural and healing for humanity if there wouldn’t be those
extreme dance techniques where some do and others watch, but rather that
many people should dance and use the healing effects of dance for
themselves. (Early 50’s, 2 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-1">Theme 1: Am I, as a dancer really ‘in tune’ with my body
and what does that mean for becoming a dance therapist?</h2>
<br />
I am going to start with an observation which jumped out at me during my
first open day seminar, and which then accompanied me throughout the
rest of the time and still does.<br />
The thought was, even though I am a dancer and feel very in tune to my
body’s physical needs, it does not mean that my mind/psyche and body are
in tune with each other. Whilst being in the position of the client in a
therapy session, or participant during the seminars, I found it very
difficult to judge whether what my body was doing was ‘true’ or ‘honest’
reflections of my inner state or emotions. I asked myself, did I really
just move in that way because it was honestly what I needed to
physically express, or was that an ingrained movement quality or pattern
just being reproduced? I didn’t trust it, I judged it, which is also
typical of a dancer, at least of myself.<br />
This lead me to question what it would mean if I were to pursue the path
of a therapist? Should I to try to ‘get rid’ of these movement patterns,
if so, how?<br />
<br />
I asked Dirk about his perspective on this topic:<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ’I believe that we are schooled, as professional dancers, to
be able to deliver all movement qualities on demand. Of course there are
preferences for how someone likes to move, but I think that it is mostly
integrated from the outside. You can say, now, do a movement like this,
and then with a bit of rehearsal it’s there. But sometimes it’s not
coming from the inside, it’s not honest, not really felt. If a dancer
would come into a dance therapy session, and you ask them to move, then
everything would come from recall and it wouldn’t actually have anything
to do with the person… you have to be able to function every day, going
to the theatre and dancing 7 or 8 hours a day. You can’t always feel ‘oh
here I feel a bit closed’, of course it’s possible but I believe you
have to be able to block that in order to function. Sometimes you have
to trick yourself and manipulate yourself.’</span><br />
<br />
Andrew also had some insight to share:<span> </span><br />
<span><strong>ANDREW</strong>: ’I would say that in my improvisation workshops, the people
that have the hardest time, are the people with the most dance training.
I feel they have had models of what dancing is, put into their bodies,
and so it is often quite difficult for them to think beyond showing
their training to an audience. People who’ve never done any training
often have fewer options physically, but they can make choices based on
what they enjoy.</span><br />
<span>I think my job is to help the participants to find the “doors” that
give them permission and then the development that occurs from having a
good time. Of course technical dance training is great for getting jobs
in contemporary dance, and that’s not to be sniffed at, at
all.’</span><br />
<br />
Now that I am reflecting on this question several months later down the
track, I think I can answer myself, that no, I do not have to try to
‘get rid’ of my training and movement patterns. It wouldn’t be possible
anyway, I would not want to get rid of it. I can be very thankful for
and proud of my dance training and all that it has brought me in terms
of a hugely diverse movement repertoire and a kinaesthetic intelligence.
What I do believe though is that the work for me is in becoming acutely
aware of my movement patterns. Which leads me very well into the next
theme…<br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-2">Theme 2: Laban Movement Analysis</h2>
<br />
One very important and basic foundation in dance therapy is the Laban
Movement Analysis. I knew about Rudolf Laban, I had probably studied him
back in dance history class in high school. But I didn’t realise that he
was such a key figure and pioneer in the dance therapy world. His system
of movement analysis came up often during my dance therapy research. It
is useful to recognise one’s own movement patterns already as a dancer,
but as a dance therapist it is crucial and a very important part of the
self-therapy aspect of the training.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ’In a movement analysis in the style of Laban, we look at what
Laban calls ‘Efforts’. Because of the theatre and my work, my
preferences were to move fast, indirect and bound. They were the main
things. Fast, indirect and bound, zack zack zack. I could also move
slowly and also liked moving slowly, it wasn’t that. But I think that we
often look for virtuosity in dance, at what’s effective. There’s too
much doing, it’s not necessary… and I think that many dancers have
integrated an output/performance thing, which of course I also had, it’s
about ‘performance’ in dance.’</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: ‘Laban and Bartenieff played a large role in my studies in New
York. Every week we did a Laban movement analysis. The subtitles are
Effort and Shape. This allows you to recognise and confront the
preferences you have in your way of moving. For example, how you use
strength, and tempo. It gives you a way to reflect about your whole
life, a way to view your life and your relationships. Also how you
relate to postures… our conversation right now is a continuous pas de
deux. My hand movements always have a resonance to your head, your eyes,
your posture. It’s not about right or wrong. Every relationships is
healing through the exchange of energy. A resonance takes place.’
</span><br />
<span>…</span><br />
<span>‘I am someone who is incredibly fast, in thinking, acting, and
working. Whereas Laura, because of her disposition is extremely slow.
When I, because of my disposition become fast and hectic, and loose the
overview, then she becomes slower and slower. And then every now and
then there’s an explosion, in the past many times, but now we are
conscious of this. Now Laura will make a joke and say ‘cool down Mama’…
to be able to accept that, and understand that, can be very helpful for
relationships… And for example to notice how you behave in a room. If
you are always so narrow and tight, then you can never take your space,
or tell the world and people around you ‘hey now stop, I also have my
place here.’ To be able to understand one’s basic patterns is very
helpful, and that’s what the Bewegungsanalyse (movement analysis) is
about.’</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>ANDREW</strong>: ‘I was given the mission of developing something that looked
like dance therapy, in my time at RVIB. Once again I must mention
another formidable woman, Margaret Bull who ran the Early Childhood
Program at RVIB. A visionary driven by an uncompromising desire for the
highest quality program for the children.</span><br />
<span>I was very happy with the fact that we were just getting very good
at this adaptive educational technique. Modify the material so that it's
of benefit to the individual with 'this or that'. They were exciting
times. I had to develop my own analysis tools (using LMA) as part of the
assessment of the program. At that time in the Melbourne Dance Therapy
community we were very humble, trying to get good at our particular
practice with our particular populations . We knew we were not
developmentally ready to bring in the psychotherapeutic approach that
the US dance therapists had adopted by then. I would never hold people
back from that approach, but helping people and their well being through
dancing, was the idea we all had. </span><br />
<span>It was incredibly helpful that we also shared LMA vocabulary from
our training with Karen, Hanny, Linda and Phil. Hanny was also very much
driven by aesthetics and I think this influenced us a great
deal.</span><br />
<span>I guess we didn’t really talk about enlightenment and all the
metaphysics but we could talk about the movement, and I loved that, it
felt very concrete and when combined with the aesthetic understanding
each dance was something that no one else in a multi-disciplinary team
could bring to RVIB.</span><br />
<span>I think there is a continuum: there’s a thing called dancing,
there's a thing called dance teaching, and there's a thing called dance
therapy. And there was a sliding along that continuum.’</span><br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-3">Theme 3: ‘Therapy’ and ‘who am I?’</h2>
<br />
I remember being a little surprised when I learnt that a big part of the
dance therapy vocational training entailed engaging in therapy oneself.
Now that I understand more about dance therapy, I understand why it is
so essential if one intends to work as a therapist. Everyone has their
issues to work through. Becoming aware of them and working through them
through therapy will ensure that I can look after myself and my future
clients/patients. It’s also about having the experience of being in a
therapeutic situation oneself, to understand what it is like. I had
never been in any kind of therapy session before. Being in those
situations I definitely didn’t feel free! It made be feel quite
uncomfortable actually. And there was no resolution of those feelings. I
just had to be ok with observing myself like that and content with
assuming that once I would dive into the therapy training that I would
be fine and able to work through it.<br />
It was reassuring to hear from Dirk how he spoke about his therapy
training.<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ‘I think it was a process. During my vocational training I had
to do a ‘Learning Therapy’, with supervision, and also self-therapy, for
quite a long time actually, including analysis. I spent a long time
getting to know myself better. When I think about how I used to move at
the beginning of my therapy, and how I move now, ok I am older too, but
I think that I have changed.’</span><br />
<br />
I am a reluctant improviser. I usually have the feeling I have to prove
something, impress someone, be creative and virtuosic. Even in the dance
therapy sessions I attended, in those moments I was doubting myself if I
was really free of self judgements and expectations. And so I always
came back to the question of, as a trained dancer will I ever be able to
move freely? Even if I’m only improvising for myself, how many of these
movement habits still surface?<br />
It was particularly interesting to discuss this topic with Dirk, as he
was also a dancer in the state theatre world. He knew exactly the kind
of environments I had been in.<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ’When we are in dance training, so often the mirror is there,
or a balletmaster, or someone who acts as a corrective, a choreographer,
who says ‘I like that, I don’t like that.’ It’s always about the outside
perspective. What is interesting, how do I make myself interesting? When
250 people go to an audition, you ask yourself how do I make myself
interesting, what do I have to do to stand out? And clearly, that is
such a narcissistic theme, actually it’s horrible that you always have
to be liked by someone, and that you are told ‘I like this, I don’t like
you.’</span><br />
<br />
Actually it was exactly in an audition situation soon after deciding to
become a freelancer, that I was told just to ‘show us who you
are…’<br />
Wow that statement somehow hit me hard. I realised that I had no idea
what kind of dancer I was, having been in a repertoire company where you
fit yourself into every choreographer’s style who comes through. I
shared this experience with Dirk:<br />
<span>‘I find that a very touching and interesting question. You also
brought that up during the DITAT orientation seminar. You mentioned that
actually, you don’t know what makes you you, when you take all that
away. Because when you don’t have anyone from outside saying ‘I like
that’, then you have to ask yourself, what do I like? Or, how do I want
to do things?’</span><br />
<br />
Some years have passed since that audition. I believe that through time
and just being active and successful in the freelance scene helped me
find peace with ‘being me’. I don’t need to add anything extra, or
‘rediscover’ myself in order to be a freelance artist. I already have so
much I just have to be proud of it and use it!<br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-4">Theme 4: Is it an advantage to have been a dancer?</h2>
<br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: ‘I know that during my time, which is quite a long time ago,
that both sides were important. The personality and life experience that
you bring, the ‘character’ that you always bring is very important. But
also your dance experience is important, as they are the tools with
which you work.’</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ’I think that is one of the core discussions in the Dance
Therapy scene. Because people come from both sides, from the
psycho-pedagogical, or the psychosocial, or the psychotherapeutic side,
or from dance and the artistic side. I think that both have advantages
and disadvantages. The beautiful thing is that they meet. But that is
just my opinion. The roots of dance therapy come from dancers and
choreographers. It was the trained dancers and choreographers who said
ok, now we are going to go into the psychiatric clinics to dance with
people and see what happens. There were no methods to begin with, but
people came from their dance background with the idea that it could be
beneficial for people. They just learnt by doing, seeing: ok when I do
this then that happens, or, that feels really good to me, so why not for
someone else?</span><br />
<span>I believe that dancers have a very broad movement repertoire, they
can move in very differentiated ways, that maybe others can’t. Of course
I am looking at this from a dancers perspective, but the origin of dance
therapy came form Isadora Duncan, Mary Wigman, Laban, and they are all
people who came from modern dance. They are our great grandmothers and
great grandfathers, and I am proud of that as a dancer… I believe that
in dance therapy, dance must be at the centre, the body must be at the
centre, that’s why people want it and do it.’</span><br />
<br />
I was also curious to ask Dirk if sometimes the clients felt intimidated
by the fact that he was a professional dancer:<br />
<span>‘…most of the time the clients know that I was a dancer because they
have looked at my website. Or they know me from other contexts, from one
of my workshops for example. And then because of that they really want
to work with me. However sometimes it does happen that they think oh!
‘’now you are watching me and it’s not good enough’’. But I try to
create an atmosphere of acceptance in the therapy, and to build a
relationship of trust before anything happens, to be clear that it’s not
about that at all. It’s not my therapeutical process. I am just a guide,
and I look on with empathy/sympathy/goodwill. And interest, just
interest, without judgement, what is that there? I am curious and often
fascinated, and when you are curious then you think more like ohhhh ok
what is that now? And maybe you don’t know! I believe that when you are
in a therapeutical process, you have to know a lot, but then you have to
forget everything when you come in contact with the client. I let myself
get taken along. And I’m thinking ohhh how does that feel right now? And
later I reflect on that, or also as I’m going. It is always important in
a therapeutic relationship to give resonance. I let myself be invited to
resonate.’</span><br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-5">Theme 5: What qualities are necessary for being a dance therapist?</h2>
<br />
This was something that I asked most people I spoke to, and it was also
a question in my survey. So I have also included some quotes from that.
The responses speak for themselves!<br />
<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ‘Many! I believe that the first thing you need, or what I find
important, is a kind of therapeutical humbleness, or humility. And
respect for others. But I think humbleness is the most important. To be
able to say, I don’t know everything, I have my own problems, I am not
finished. I find it good to stay on eye level. A reference to the
humanistic perspective. That I find important. But I also find it super
important to have empathy. And an openness. And not to be so moral -
you’re allowed to do this but not this. I find it needs an openness, and
just a lot of curiosity. With curiosity you have a lot of room to play,
to just observe what is happening. And then a lot depends on the client,
you do need to be able to keep the thread going, and to know
methodologically speaking what you are doing, you need good
training.’</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: ‘Courage, patience. To be able to look away from yourself.
Your own ego has to be put in the background. You have to have the
humbleness to realise that what you give people now as developmental
opportunities might not be taken up until 10 years time, or not at all.
It is a gift to be at all present during such a creative development in
others. Thankfulness is infinitely important. </span><br />
<span>You have to have courage to go into dark rooms, into the shadows.
Patience, that growth often needs a lot of time and that you won’t
always see it. Thankfulness, courage, patience, fascination for the
creativity which wants to show itself and for human potential. The
ability of oneself to be in the background. </span><br />
<span>You can’t be lacking for yourself, you need to be able to feed
yourself, you have to able to be happy in life yourself. So that you
don’t need the healing or development of the patients to fulfil
yourself. You put your patients on the stage of life, their Lifestage.
The difficult part in therapeutic work is that we can project our shadow
on the client, for example when we are jealous of the client because
they have achieved something that we haven’t.’</span><br />
<br />

<br />
<h2 id="theme-6">Theme 6: Tips for dancers wanting to become therapists</h2>
<br />
I think I only asked Dirk this question, so here is his answer:<br />
<strong>DIRK</strong>: I believe that it is important in the job as dancer to be able to
take care of oneself, to be able to see what do I need right now? It is
super important to know with whom one is dancing, what kind of people
are they? Is it a nice place? For what am I making myself available? I
think if you want to get into dance therapy you just need to take the
step, to just start, and say, I want to understand myself in a new way,
and to broaden my knowledge. I think that often happens through
pedagogical work, that’s how it happened for me. I wanted to understand
better, I felt that something was missing, I had an idea of it, but I
was missing a method and a sense of security, I didn’t want to just poke
around.<br />
I think it is good to bring the body into psychotherapeutical
situations. Even when you eventually decide to work therapeutically, you
can do it sitting, or lying down, or back and forth, but I believe that
when you have been accompanied by dance your whole life, it would be
strange to throw it all away.<br />
Something that you could do as a dancer, is to observe each other
improvising. To notice what are the different qualities? The classic
therapeutical question is, what does that do to me? You have to change
your perspective from ‘do I like that?’ to ‘what does that do to
me?’.<br />
<br />
Something that Mona mentioned I find valuable to add here:<br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: ‘For me it’s very important that dance therapy is seen as part
of a larger platter of therapeutical possibilities. Art, music,
ergo-therapy. For some people dance is enticing, for others it’s
writing, or music. That is very important, I have to respect that.
Healing always needs personal motivation to really be able to heal. And
part of that is the free choice of the therapeutical method.’
</span><br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-7">Theme 7: What do you like most about being a dance therapist?</h2>
<br />
<strong>MONA</strong>: ‘Because dance in itself is movement, an exchange of energy, it’s
the primal potion, with which we are incarnated. Even from the moment
the sperm meet the egg, even that is in movement, and everything is
dance. If you look in the biology, in the atomic research, everything is
dance. Since I was small there was always a strong allurement, a
fascination, to want to comprehend, understand and penetrate that. It’s
such a mystery…<br />
I am focused on life, not on ‘pathology’ which is the conventional
medical approach. I give space and tools, and opportunities so that you
can discover your core essence, that you discover your potential. And I
look on with thankfulness and joy at how life unfolds. A more beautiful
creative work I cannot imagine. ‘<br />
<br />
<strong>DIRK</strong>: ‘I find it exciting to be allowed to accompany people through
their personal process of growth. There are so many ways to live life,
and it’s fun to be able to accompany this, hopefully I do it well! It’s
not always easy but it is very fulfilling.’<br />
<br />
From the survey:<br />
<strong>‘Dass es um das 'Wirkliche' geht! Der Tanz und die Bewegung -
für die, die sich auf das Abenteuer Tanztherapie eingelassen haben -
erlaubt den unmittelbaren Zugang zur Seele des Menschen. Zitat "Der
Körper lügt nicht". Mit Gesprächstherapie kann sich jeder 'rausreden',
ausweichen, mit Worten. Alles kann so lange dauern, bis die Pat. auf
ihre Themen kommen, Antworten finden, weiterkommen. Über die Bewegung
geht das so viel schneller. Es ist unglaublich befriedigend, sie dabei
zu begleiten und das Wunder der eigenen Intuition dabei zu erleben.’
(Mitte 60, 12 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
‘That it is all about ‘the essential’. Dance and movement, for those who
have agreed to embark on the dance therapy adventure, allows direct
access to the human soul. Quote: “the body does not lie”. In talk
therapy anyone can ‘dodge the topic’, avoid it, with words. It can take
a long time until patients identify their themes, find answers, make
progress. Through movement this process goes so much faster. It is
unbelievably satisfying to guide patients and to witness the wonder of
one’s own intuition.’ (Mid 60’s, 12 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Kreativität - Tanztherapie eröffnet Tiefen, die Worte nicht
erreichen - bringt Inneres nach Außen, macht sichtbar, was spürbar ist -
diesen Prozess mitzuerleben berührt ungemein.’ (Mitte 30, 7 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘Creativity - Dance Therapy opens depths, which words can’t reach - it
brings the inside to the outside and makes it visible, which is palpable
- witnessing this process is immensely touching.’ (Mid 30’s, 7 yrs
practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Die permanente Kreativität, die Nähe zu den Patientinnen, sie
auf diese Art und Weise unterstützen zu können, die Freude, Emotionen
über Tanz und Bewegung auszudrücken…’ (Mitte 50, 19 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘The permanent creativity, the closeness to the patients, being able to
support them in this way, the joy of expressing emotions through dance
and movement…’ (Mid 50’s, 19 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Das Feedback meiner Klienten, mit Lebensfreude und Lebendigkeit
immer wieder in Kontakt zu kommen, die Abwechslung, der Tanz und die
Bewegung, Menschen zu berühren.’ (Ende 40, 10 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘The feedback from my clients, getting in touch with vitality and
liveliness again and again, the variety, the dance and the movement,
touching people.’ (Late 40’s, 10 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
…and so many more inspiring answers, as usual it was so hard to
choose!<br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-8">Theme 8: Do you see a positive change in people?</h2>
<br />
I was curious to hear from people if they witnessed improvement or any
kind of ‘miraculous’ healing experiences through their work. I think I
just wanted to hear real-life accounts of the positive benefits of dance
therapy. Because in theory it may sound amazing and make sense in my
mind but in practice that might be a very different thing! But not so,
as Dirk and Mona, and other participants from the survey outline,
positive change is a sure thing, no matter how small!<br />
<br />
<span><strong>DIRK</strong>: ‘I see a lot of change, always. I often come out of a session
entirely impressed. I am so touched by the processes, it requires a lot
of courage. It’s amazing to see the movement repertoire in someone
slowly grow. It might become freer, bigger, or smaller, just different.
In dance therapy we base our work on the understanding that the mind and
the body are in constant exchange. When there is a change in the way
someone moves their body then things change in other areas, that’s the
essence of this work.’</span><br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: ‘We always had teachers, theologians, doctors etc coming to us
who said that without dance therapy once a week, they would have quit
their job a long time ago. Any profession which gives, with which you
work with people in an emotional, social and pedagogical context, for
them it’s ‘psychic-hygiene’. They can be in body and mind completely for
themselves, they can cleanse themselves. For them it is deeply cleansing
and healing. You can learn so much about yourself when you study the way
you are in the world once a week, through movement and dance you can
experience so much.’</span><br />
<br />
From the survey:<br />
<strong>‘Im klinischen Alltag erlebt man selten "große" Veränderungen
und praktisch nie das Ende der Geschichte, daher folgt hier vielleicht
nicht das, was sie meinen, aber das, was mir zu ihrer Frage einfällt: -
eine traumatisierte Patientin, die nach Jahren ambulanter Begleitung in
Gruppen-Tanztherapie ihr Leben bewältigen kann und auch in Krisen sich
selbst regulieren kann…Senioren, die den ganzen Tag stumm und verwirrt
am Tisch sitzen und dann in einer gemeinsamen Stunde sich am Springen
eines Balles erfreuen und sich zur Musik wiegen ein bißchen mitsingen,
wenn ein paar Worte zurückfinden und dann sogar zu unwahrscheinlichen
Sätzen fähig sind, wie : "so glücklich war ich schon lange nicht mehr -
Ich danke Ihnen sehr, wann kommen sie wieder?” (Anfang 60, 17 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘In clinical everyday life one rarely experiences "big" changes and you
practically never see the end of the story. So what I’ll describe here
is maybe not what you mean, but what comes to my mind in answer to your
question: - a traumatised patient who after years of outpatient guidance
in group dance therapy is able to cope with her life and regulate
herself even in crises… Elderly people who sit at the table all day mute
and confused, then during a session enjoy bouncing a ball and swaying to
the music, singing along a little, when a few words find their way back
and then they are even capable of sentences like: "I haven't been this
happy in a long time - thank you very much, when will you come back?”
(Early 60’s, 17 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘… wenn Sie jetzt das Lächeln auf meinem Gesicht sähen, würden
Sie sehen, dass ich mich an manche Fälle ganz besonders gern erinnere,
weil die Veränderungen so krass waren und manchmal durch ganz einfache
Interventionen ausgelöst wurden!’ (Mitte 60, 12 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘… if you saw the smile on my face now, you would see that I remember
some cases particularly fondly, because the changes were so stark and
sometimes triggered by very simple interventions!’ (Mid 60’s, 12 yrs
practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Ich arbeite in einem Bereich mit schwer psychisch erkrankten
Erwachsenen, in dem es selten "große positive Veränderungen" gibt. Die
Tatsache, dass meine Klienten regelmäßig gekommen sind, den Kontakt mit
anderen ausgehalten haben und es gelungen ist, eigene Ängste und
Beziehungen zu anderen TN zu thematisieren, dass sie im Tanzen für
andere sichtbar geworden sind ist bereits als großer Erfolg zu werten.’
(Mitte 30, 6 Jahre tätig)</strong><br />
I work in an area with severely mentally ill adults where there are
rarely "big positive changes". The fact that my clients came regularly,
endured the contact with others, succeeded in addressing their own fears
and relationships with other participants, and that they became visible
to others through dancing, can already be considered a great success.’
(Mid 30’s, 6 yrs practice)<br />
<br />
<strong>‘Selbst in kurzer Zeit verändern sich einige menschen sehr,
werden offener, lassen los. Das hat nicht nur mit der TT zu tun, sondern
mit dem gesamten "Paket" in der Reha.’ (Mitte 50, 5 Jahre
tätig)</strong><br />
‘Even within a short time some people change a lot, become more open,
letting go. This has not only to do with dance therapy, but with the
“package" in rehab. (Mid 50’s, 5 yrs practice).<br />
<br />
<h2 id="theme-9">Theme 9: Transitioning/ageing as a dancer</h2>
<br />
In talking with Andrew we also spoke about the very relevant topic of
ageing as a dancer. He shared an interesting perspective which I found
really inspiring. I have always had the aspiration to stay in dance and
theatre as long as possible, as a performer, and he made me reflect back
on that desire which had maybe been put away, and give it some more
credit.<br />
<br />
<span><strong>ANDREW</strong>: ‘I think one of the problems that professional contemporary
dance has is that so much of it remains adolescent, and the “you get to
your 30's then you stop” model.</span><br />
<span>In my 50's I said to myself, ‘’if I heard that there was someone, 70
years old, somewhere in the world who'd been improvising for 40 years,
who was doing long solo improvisations in cellars and attics, I’d go
anywhere in the world to see them.’’ </span><br />
<span>And I realised I could be that guy! </span><br />
<span>The field needs the idea that you can still do it when you're 70.
And it shouldn't look like it looked like when you were 33. Most of the
older dancers I see, keep dancing because they can hold on to what they
used to do 10 years ago. People love it and say things like they are so
“good for their age”. I think they should be dancing like a 45 year old,
when they are 45. But every 45 year old you see performing is pretending
they're 35! </span><br />
<span>I sometimes talk about that when I perform, saying,” I'm moving like
this not because I think this is a great way to move, I’m moving in
because this is the way a 70 year old man dances. You need to know that,
the world needs to know, this is what a 70 yr old men look like when
they dance, because all the other 70 yr old men you see dancing, in this
kind of context; they’re all pretending they're 15 years
younger.”</span><br />
<span>Of course it's wonderful to watch really virtuosic dancing by young
people, it's really gorgeous. However it has meant that the perception
of what dance is has stayed in an adolescent model. How high, how fast,
how long, you know all of those kind of questions, and these are
irrelevant questions to people in their 60s. These things simply don’t
matter anymore, and that's good I think. </span><br />
<span>The real question is how dance can mature and the answer can be
found very simply by mature people maintaining amateur and sustainable
practice.</span><br />
<span>We lose generation upon generation of young dancers because they
can't find a way to grow inside the field. Dancers are trained in a way
to be passive and to be told what to do, or to be given guidance about
when they can do it, and how they can do it, and then if you're the
least bit good people will start giving you advice about what you have
to do to get more success, get more funding, so you get shaped by that
whole process, all of that's completely great I think, but you just
don’t let that be the whole story or the end of the story. Dance needs
to be bigger and more robust than that.’ </span><br />
<br />
<h2 id="side-question">Last little side question and sign off</h2>
<br />
When I asked Mona how she integrates dance therapy into her life, this
is what she said:<br />
<span><strong>MONA</strong>: ‘A very interesting question… It runs like a matrix, like a
computer program, always on in the background. I grasped very early on,
that life, the wisdom of life, is actually understood through the body.
My dance and movement therapy work, and my gymnastic training, have
guided me throughout life’s conflicts. But especially the way in which I
have accompanied Laura, and through all my pioneering political work for
children with disabilities. I have always tried to analyse and
understand myself through movement methods. In confronting political
situations, with this physical and mental resistance, I could protect
myself, and process things… the program was always running. Without this
background, without the power of dance, Laura would certainly be living
in a special institution.’ </span><br />
<br />
So there you have it…<br />
After all this research I am an even stronger believer in the healing
potential of dance, and even more attracted to understanding it deeper.
Right now though, being a dancer is still what I love and live. Having
had the time and means to conduct this research I have gained invaluable
insights into this exciting field, which I am happy to be able to share
here with you!</p>
