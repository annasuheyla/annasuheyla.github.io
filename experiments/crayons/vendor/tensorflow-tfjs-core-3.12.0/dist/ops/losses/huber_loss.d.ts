 * Computes the huber loss between two tensors.

 * @param labels The ground truth output tensor, same dimensions as

 * @param predictions The predicted outputs.
 * @param weights Tensor whose rank is either 0, or the same rank as
 *    `labels`, and must be broadcastable to `labels` (i.e., all dimensions
 *    must be either `1`, or the same as the corresponding `losses`
 *    dimension).
 * @param delta Point where huber loss changes from quadratic to linear.
 * @param reduction Type of reduction to apply to loss. Should be of type
 *    `Reduction`.
