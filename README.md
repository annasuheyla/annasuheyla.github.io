## Sections

### Created on Us (`/experiments/`)

Exports from the [https://github.com/annasuheyla/spacejam](spacejam) repository, hosted on public webiste to be able to share links with friends and in project report.

### Dance Therapy (`/dance-therapy/`)

This article was originally written in Apple Pages, then exported to RTF and converted to HTML using pandoc. The pandoc output was then manually edited for semantic markup (headings, table of contents) and styles. If this document should be edited in the future, it would be best to make the edits directly in the HTML in this repository, as changes in the Pages document could not be brought directly to the web version (only with major manual effort).
